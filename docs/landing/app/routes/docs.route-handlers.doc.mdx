At the core of Rapid is a routing system built on the builder API found in [actix-web](https://actix.rs). Everything works via a simple file-based convention that is very similar to [NextJS](https://nextjs.org). Each route is composed of a single `.rs` file with handler functions defined inside of it. Learn more about it below:

## Defining a route

Start by creating a new file with any name you want (the name you choose will map directly to the actual url path). For this example, we'll use `hello.rs`. Inside of this file, we will define a basic handler function:

<CodeBlock
    language='rust'
    fileName='hello.rs'
	code={`use rapid_web::actix::HttpResponse;
use rapid_web::{rapid_web_codegen::rapid_handler, request::RapidPath};

pub type RapidOutput = String;

#[rapid_handler]
pub async fn query() -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse::Ok()
    .content_type("text/html; charset=utf-8")
    .body("Hello World!")
}`}
/>
