At the core of Rapid is a routing system built on the builder API found in [actix-web](https://actix.rs). Everything works via a simple file-based convention that is very similar to [NextJS](https://nextjs.org). Each route is composed of a single `.rs` file with handler functions defined inside of it. Learn more about it below:

<br />

## Defining a route

Start by creating a new file with any name you want (the name you choose will map directly to the actual url path). For this example, we'll use `hello.rs`. Inside of this file, we will define a basic handler function:

<CodeBlock
    language='rust'
    fileName='hello.rs'
	code={`use rapid_web::actix::HttpResponse;
use rapid_web::{rapid_web_codegen::rapid_handler, request::RapidPath};

pub type RapidOutput = String;

#[rapid_handler]
pub async fn query() -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse::Ok()
    .content_type("text/html; charset=utf-8")
    .body("Hello World!")
}`}
/>
<p className='mt-4'>Handlers in Rapid are just functions with special keywords that define the request type. All handlers must have a function name of either `query` or `mutation`. Using `query` will make the handler only accept GET requests and `mutation` allows for POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. </p>

## Route Keys


Every route in your project will be given a name automatically. By default, Rapid uses the name of your route file. However, if you want to specify your own route name that does not conflict with the actual path that your route resolves to, you can use a route key:
<CodeBlock
    language='rust'
	code={`use rapid_web::actix::HttpResponse;
use rapid_web::{rapid_web_codegen::rapid_handler, request::RapidPath};

// This will constant will get analyzed by the rapid compiler
// It will then be used as the identifer that you will specify on the frontend to call your handler:
pub const ROUTE_KEY: &str = "yourRouteName";

//...`}
/>
