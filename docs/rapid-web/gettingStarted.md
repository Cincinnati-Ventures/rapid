# Getting Started

1. To start developing with rapid you will first need to install the Rapid CLI:
```bash
cargo install rapid-cli
```

2. Initialize a new rapid-web project in your current working directory with the following command:
```bash
    rapid new --server
```

3. Be sure to change directories into the directory that the project was created in and then run the following to start your rapid development server:
```bash
    rapid run
```
