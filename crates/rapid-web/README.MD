# A simplified re-export of Actix-web for the Rapid framework.

## Initial features
- Simplified router + middleware
- Good defaults (CORS, logging middleware, custom error pages and better extractor error logging)
- Scaffolded orm, connection pooling, mailer, server state
- Generators for request -> service -> controller architecture
- Codegen for typescript clients with extractor type safety
- Better request/response logging in console for easy debugging

## Maybe features
- File based routing
- Custom ORM (opinionated and only works with rapid)
- Plugins?
